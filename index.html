        <!-- Why Me / Personal Story Section -->
        <section id="why-me">
            <h2>My Journey to Understanding What Makes Products Really Succeed</h2>
            <div class="personal-story-content">
                <p>Early in my career in optical fiber sensing technology, I had a moment of clarity that changed everything. I wanted to call our customers directly to understand what they actually needed - their specs were achievable, and I knew we could build something meaningful. But I was told no. That's when I realized having great technology isn't enough if you can't connect it to real customer needs.</p>
                <p>So I started my own company in agricultural irrigation technology to build products customers actually wanted. I learned that innovation alone isn't enough either - even incremental improvements need an existing customer base to make real impact. The technology was solid, but the market strategy wasn't there.</p>
                <p>In global health technology, I found the opposite problem: incredible innovation that could change lives, but no one knew how to bring it to market. I helped launch the first commercial product and got 15,000 units into 10+ countries, but the government-to-consumer market was slow and had no clear path to commercial growth.</p>
                <p>In ocean technology, I thought I'd found everything - innovative product, commercial users, real market need. I helped launch the product and support customers, even achieving a 60% cost reduction. But then I discovered the missing piece: even with great products and customers, companies still plateau without growth strategy. They were engineering-led with products everywhere but no systematic approach to expansion.</p>
                <p>That's when I understood what I'm really passionate about: I want to work with companies that have all the pieces but need someone to help them see the complete picture and execute a strategy to grow.</p>
                <p>I'm a big picture thinker and detailed executor. I'm a self-starter who creates clarity where none exists. I'm an experimenter and explorer who thinks like a startup - constantly looking at and shoring up the areas that need to be addressed for growth. Every company I've worked with taught me something essential about what makes products succeed. Now I want to bring all those lessons together to help companies that are ready to put all the pieces together and scale.</p>
